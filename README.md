[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

``` 1.step
[2,27,16,22,18,6]

2.step
[2,6,16,22,18,27]

3.step
[2,6,16,22,18,27]

4.step
[2,6,16,18,22,27]

```

Big O

```n(n+1)/2-----> O(n^2) ```

Time Complexity
```
  Best Case = O(1)
  Average Case = O(n^2)
  Worst Case = O (n^2) 
 ```
 
 What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted?
 ```
 Best Case
 ```
 
 [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] 
 
 ```
